# linux-bash-script-to-filter-out-files-logfiles-contents
This Linux bashscript is a simple 4 steps/prompts wizard to help Linux admin to find files containing certain phrasse and then list these file's lines that match defined phrasse/s and exclude lines matching excluded phrasses.

It is good for filtering out certain log lines in one or many log files
Im using it to find/filter log lines in cPanel account access-logs matching certain date/time
