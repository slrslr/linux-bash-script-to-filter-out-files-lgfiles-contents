# linux-bash-script-to-filter-out-files-logfiles-contents
This Linux bashscript is a simple 4 steps/prompts wizard to help Linux admin to find files containing certain phrase and then list these file's lines that match defined phrases and exclude lines matching excluded phrases.

It is good for filtering out certain log lines in one or many log files
Im using it to find/filter log lines in cPanel account access-logs matching certain date/time
